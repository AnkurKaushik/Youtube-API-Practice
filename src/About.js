        <p>We are designing this glove to serve as a learning tool for people who wish to learn sign language. To build this glove we need a variety of sensors and a machine learning algorithm. Background Information describes what the various components are and how they work. Whereas, Design Functionality serves to describe how they fit into the glove design. In order to ensure the glove is built with safety in mind, we are holding ourselves to OSHA and ISEAâ€™s professional standards. We are also taking into account ethical considerations involved with the glove such as intellectual property and the health of our users. Finally, we will establish what a successful project consists of by discussing our three deliverables: the electrical components, the algorithm, and the website.</p>
